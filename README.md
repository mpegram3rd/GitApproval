# GitApproval

This is just a silly little Chrome browser plug-in that let's you add Markdown based Emjoi to your Github PR approvals.

This was written for 2 reasons:
1. I wanted to learn how to write chrome extensions
1. My team likes to include these types of emojis for PR's.

Have fun and enjoy!
